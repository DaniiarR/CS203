    <p><font face="Arial">Veronika is a young woman from Ljubljana, Slovenia who appears to have a perfect life, but nevertheless decides to commit suicide by overdosing with sleeping pills.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica">While she waits to die, she cancels the suicide letter she starts to her parents while suddenly provoked by a magazine article.  </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">The magazine article wittily asks "Where is Slovenia?", so she writes a letter to the press justifying her suicide, the idea is to make the press believe that she has killed herself because people don't even know where Slovenia is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier New">Her plan fails and she wakes up from the coma in Villette, a mental hospital in Slovenia, where she is told she has only a few days to live due to heart condition caused by the overdose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Her presence there affects all of the mental hospital's patients, especially Zedka, who has clinical depression; Mari, who has panic attacks; and Eduard, who has schizophrenia, and with whom Veronika falls in love. </font></p>
