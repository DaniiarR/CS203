    <p><u>William Golding's Lord of the Flies</u> is an <strong><i>allegorical</i></strong> novel about a group of schoolboys stranded on a <strong><i>deserted</i></strong> island without any <strong><i>adult</i></strong> supervision. <strong><i>Free</i></strong> from the restraints of society, the boys form their own civilization, which quickly descends into chaos and violence. Through this tale, <u>Golding</u> explores <strong><i>fundamental</i></strong> questions about human nature. In fact, each character can be interpreted as an <strong><i>essential</i></strong> element of the allegory.</p>
